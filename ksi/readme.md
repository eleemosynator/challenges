# KSI $(\Xi)$ - Elementary Cryptanalysis Challenges

A small set of challenges based on a home-made symmetric cipher called Ksi $(\Xi)$ that I came across in the late 90s. The password for the
all challenge archives is `infected`. Successfully solving a challenge should yield a flag in the format `flag{????????}`. I hope you enjoy solving them
and they help you practice and improve your skills. Twitter DMs are open if you have any constructive feedback.

1. [ksi1997](./ksi1997.7z) - This is the original $\Xi$ cipher as it was first sent to me. It was very easy to crack even with the hardware available at the time. 


Enjoy,
